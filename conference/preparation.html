AWARENESS</h6><p>To make the public, clinicians, scientists and engineers aware of a new category  of clinical problem arising out of the recent wars. The set of talks on Sunday  will help to define a new constellation of injuries that we are seeing in the  battlefield - Polytrauma. </p><h6>2. IMPROVE CARE</h6> <p> To improve the care that polytrauma patients receive.&nbsp; To achieve this  we will need a research agenda and a strategic plan to address these injuries.  These injuries are a clinical challenge to the health care provider to render  the best treatment at the time of injury and during subsequent reconstructive  process and rehabilitation. </p><p>The conference is organized to first provide an in depth presentation of the  problem, its etiology and its mechanism. Second, provide a series of talks  on technologies that can be applied to the solution. However the task for the  participants is to come up with a research agenda and plan to implement a successful  solution for the care of polytrauma, with the overall goal of enabling these  severely injured soldiers to regain their independence.</p><h6>Sunday Afternoon</h6><ul>  <li>Present and define the problem of Polytrauma </li></ul><h6>Sunday Night &ndash; Monday Afternoon</h6><ul>  <li>Present state of the art technologies and systems that can be used as part    of the solution. These technologies fall into three broad categories - biology,    robotics and simulation.</li></ul><h6>3. ENVISION A SUCCESSFUL POLYRAUMA RESEARCH PROGRAM</h6> <p> We would like each of the invited participants to begin thinking about and    working on a research agenda that would allow us to improve the care for    these patients. Following the initial series of talks on Sunday and Monday,    the participants will be divided into three break out groups:</p><h3>Group Tasks</h3><ul>  <li>Work on both short term (less than 5 years) and long term ( greater than    5 years) research agendas for the improvement of care for Polytrauma. </li></ul><ul>  <li>Seriously consider how your envisioned research program would provide both    incremental improvements, and in some cases revolutionary improvements in    treating these severe multi-system injuries. </li></ul><ul>  <li>Present your findings on Tuesday morning.</li></ul><h6>NOTE</h6><p>Although the groups will first gather officially Monday afternoon and present  their findings and research agendas Tuesday morning, we would like everyone  to take some significant time over the next few days to begin this work. </p><p>To help in this process - re-read the assumptions that are provided in the  brochure. They will help in understanding the unique challenge that is presented  by polytrauma and its injuries to multiple systems - brain, vision, hearing,  facial function and limbs.</p><h6>CONTACT</h6><p>If you have key articles that you would like to share please send them to  me at <a href="mailto:Joseph.Rosen@dartmouth.edu">Joseph.Rosen@dartmouth.edu</a> and  I will include them on the conference website.</p><h6>DOWNLOAD PRINT VERSION OF THIS PAGE</h6><p>Download <a href="docs/Conference_Preparation.doc">Conference Preparation Doc</a></p></div><div class="separator"></div><!-- Here is the footer below content that includes the new footer some from from koop institute --><div id="footer">[<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu">Dartmouth Home]</a> [<a href="#">about</a>][<a href="http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/thayer/index.html">Thayer School Home</a>][<a href="http://dms.dartmouth.edu/koop/">Koop Institute</a>]<a href="about.html"></a><br /> <a href="http://dms.dartmouth.edu/" target="_blank">Dartmouth Medical School</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dhmc.org/" target="_blank">Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www1.va.gov/directory/guide/facility.asp?ID=147&dnum=ALL&map=1" target="_blank">White River Junction VAMC</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/" target="_blank">Dartmouth College</a>        <br>		Copyright 2006 Trustees of Dartmouth College<br />		November 28, 2006 - Draft</div></div></div></body></html>

These devices consist of explosives such as 155 mm artillery shells that are hidden and remotely detonated against dismounted servicemen or their convoys.  In the U.S. alone, the number of servicemen currently suffering from severe Polytrauma is well over 100.  This number grows substantially when considering the issue of Polytrauma in a larger context.</p><p>In prior wars, servicemen often did not survive the events   capable of causing such severe multiple injuries.  However, in   this war, new body armor, improved combat casualty care, and   more rapid evacuation procedures have caused a substantial   improvement in the survival rate of wounded servicemen.  For   instance, the ratio of WIA to KIA in prior wars averaged 3 to 1,   at present the ratio is roughly 8 to 1. Moreover, in accordance   with this shift in the ratio of WIA to KIA, there has been a shift   in the severity of the injuries.  The Polytrauma injuries often   include injuries to the hands, feet, arms, legs, face, and brain; as   well as impairment of vision and hearing.  Additionally, severe   brain injuries from blasts, fragment penetration of the skull, and   severe facial disfigurement are not uncommon.  Severe facial   disfigurement can sometimes lead to degraded speech function,   limited and distorted facial expression, and excessive drooling.  </p><p>At present, there is no treatment or rehabilitation approach that   is adequately matched to these Polytrauma patients. Although   there are exceptions, current approaches are generally focused   on a single problem, such as limb loss or hearing loss, and are   overwhelmed by the Polytrauma patient.  During our conference   at Dartmouth, we intend to bring together experts from multiple   fields in order to consider how best to address the Polytrauma   challenge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>  <div class="separator">	</div>     <div class="separator"></div><!-- Here is the footer below content that includes the new footer some from from koop institute --><div id="footer">[<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu">Dartmouth Home]</a> [<a href="#">about</a>][<a href="http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/thayer/index.html">Thayer School Home</a>][<a href="http://dms.dartmouth.edu/koop/">Koop Institute</a>]<a href="about.html"></a><br /> <a href="http://dms.dartmouth.edu/" target="_blank">Dartmouth Medical School</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dhmc.org/" target="_blank">Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www1.va.gov/directory/guide/facility.asp?ID=147&dnum=ALL&map=1" target="_blank">White River Junction VAMC</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/" target="_blank">Dartmouth College</a>        <br>		Copyright 2006 Trustees of Dartmouth College<br />		November 29, 2006 - Draft</div></div></div></body></html>

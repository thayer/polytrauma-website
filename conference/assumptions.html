The following paragraphs outline  some current assumptions about the program (assumptions that may be altered  or supplemented at the proposed conference). </p><p>Assumption A</p><p>Independent of one's political views about policies and events that have led  to the existence of these Polytrauma patients, and independent of the number  of such patients that exist and choose to be rehabilitated, it is assumed that  it is worth making a serious effort to develop an effective Polytrauma program  to help such patients.</p><p> Assumption B  </p><p>In order for such a program to be effective, it must contain efforts at two  levels. First, there must be a near- term clinical effort to rehabilitate current  Polytrauma patients by exploiting to the fullest extent possible existing physical  and psychological treatment modalities. Second, there must be a serious long-term  research effort to develop more effective treatments than those now readily  accessible. </p><p>Assumption C  </p><p>Rehabilitation and treatment programs for Polytrauma patients constructed  by applying independent, already existing single-trauma programs will be vastly  inferior to a Polytrauma program developed specifically for Polytrauma patients.  This inferiority arises from two sources. First, many of the treatments for  single-trauma patients are critically dependent on the normal functioning of  the systems not being addressed. Second, the use of independent treatments  fails to capitalize on the extent to which economies of treatment, like economies  of scale, can be realized with an integrated approach. </p><p>Assumption  D </p><p>The envisioned Polytrauma program will extend current work on the Polytrauma  problem not only by considering all the injuries of each Polytrauma case in  a unified fashion, but also by engaging and integrating organizations, disciplines,  facilities, and personnel that cover a broad range. In addition to components  in the medical and rehabilitation domains (concerned with psychological as  well as physical problems), scientific and engineering components (biology,  physics, chemistry, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering) will  also be well represented. It is anticipated that any successful program will  involve individuals from academia, industry, and government, and individuals  focused on program administration and funding as well as on the content of  the Polytrauma program. </p><p>Assumption E  </p><p>Despite the assumption that a robust Polytrauma program is worth pursuing  even if it only helps the population of Polytrauma patients, it is expected  that results achieved in this program will have substantial   "spin-off" for other populations. In particular, it is believed that the program  will lead to significant benefits for the aged and for patients of diseases  such as cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, and spinal cord injuries that lead  to multiple failures in normal functioning. </p></div><div class="separator"></div><!-- Here is the footer below content that includes the new footer some from from koop institute --><div id="footer">[<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu">Dartmouth Home]</a> [<a href="#">about</a>][<a href="http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/thayer/index.html">Thayer School Home</a>][<a href="http://dms.dartmouth.edu/koop/">Koop Institute</a>]<a href="about.html"></a><br /> <a href="http://dms.dartmouth.edu/" target="_blank">Dartmouth Medical School</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dhmc.org/" target="_blank">Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www1.va.gov/directory/guide/facility.asp?ID=147&dnum=ALL&map=1" target="_blank">White River Junction VAMC</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/" target="_blank">Dartmouth College</a>        <br>		Copyright 2006 Trustees of Dartmouth College<br />		November 28, 2006 - Draft</div></div></div></body></html>

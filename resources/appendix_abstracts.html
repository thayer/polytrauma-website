These injuries include both  kinetic (i.e., penetrating wounds) as well as other destructive injuries  (chemical and thermal burns, musculoskeletal injuries, blast  overpressure, etc.). RIR aims to replace the current concepts of &quot;wound  coverage&quot; by fibrosis and scarring with true &quot;wound healing&quot; by  regeneration of fully differentiated, functional tissue.</p><p>The program will achieve its goals by developing a comprehensive  understanding of the wound environment, including cellular elements,  matrix, inflammatory mediators, growth factors, nutrients, substrate  utilization, biofilms, and ultimately processes of morphogenesis leading  to anatomic and functional restoration. This is an extremely aggressive,  milestone-driven program, with a Phase 1 effort focused on defining the  wound environment and generating a blastema in an otherwise  non-regenerating animal. This will be followed by a Phase 2 effort,  which will culminate in the restoration of a functional multi-tissue  structure in a mammal.</p><p>National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory<br />  Research (NCRAR) </p><p>Director's Meeting for VA Centers of Excellence<br />  in Rehabilitiaton Research and Development, which Portland  - talk on blast trauma by Dr. Lew  of the Palo Alto VA Polytrauma Center.

Zacharski  <p> A packet of information  illustrating the range of therapies available for  such &quot;prohemostatic&quot; therapy.    Aprotinin is of special interest because it is non-toxic, and both prohemostatic    and antithrombotic. It is FDA approved for blood sparing in CABG surgery. </p><p>Lisa Vande Vusse, Medical House Staff,  is working with us on a report of about a half dozen cases having difficult  bleeding problem that we treated successfully with aprotinin here at DHMC.  There are, therefore, several options to consider that should be much less  expensive and less toxic than recombinant facto VIIa. </p><p>Address comments or questions to <a href="mailto:Lisa.K.Vande.Vusse@Hitchcock.ORG"> Lisa.K.Vande.Vusse@Hitchcock.ORG </a> or  <a href="mailto:Leo.R.Zacharski@Dartmouth.edu">Leo.R.Zacharski@Dartmouth.edu.</a> </p><p><a href="../conference/docs/Anti-thrombotic_properties.doc">Download Doc </a></p><h6> Burn Unit -Brigham and Women's Hospital</h6><p> <a href="http://www.brighamandwomens.org/research/research.aspx">http://www.brighamandwomens.org/research/research.aspx</a> </p><p><a href="http://www.brighamandwomens.org/BurnTrauma/BurnCenter/BurnCenterMain.aspx">http://www.brighamandwomens.org/BurnTrauma/BurnCenter/BurnCenterMain.aspx</a></p><p>Dennis P.
